                    1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?
                </h2>
                <p class="px-4">
                    <strong>DOM:</strong> The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web
                    Consortium) standard. <br />
                    The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and
                    language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts
                    to dynamically access and update the content, structure and
                    style of a document. <br />
                    <br />
                    The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
                    <br />
                    (i) Core DOM - standard model for all document types. <br />
                    (ii) XML DOM - standard model for XML documents. <br />
                    (iii) HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p class="px-4">
                    <strong>Purpose of DOM:</strong> Its purpose is to provide a
                    structured representation of an HTML or XML document so that
                    programs or scripts can change the document structure,
                    style, content and manipulate or interact with the page.

                    2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM?
                </h2>
                <p class="px-4">
                    There are 6 ways to select elements in a DOM using
                    selectors: <br />
                    i. getElementById() <br />
                    ii. getElementsByClassName()<br />
                    iii. getElementsByTagName() <br />
                    iv. querySelector()<br />
                    v. querySelectorAll()<br />
                    vi. getElementsByName() - only that elements which has a
                    name attribute.

                    3. What is event bubble?
                </h2>
                <p class="px-4">
                    Event bubble is a concept in the DOM. <br />
                    It happens when an element receives an event and that event
                    bubbles up (or propagates up) to its parent and ancestor
                    elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root
                    element.<br />
                    This is the default behavior of events on elements unless to
                    stop the propagation.

                    4. What is the callback function and why will you use it?
                </h2>
                <p class="px-4">
                    A callback function is a function that is passed into
                    another function as an argument which is then invoked inside
                    the outer function to complete some kind of routine or
                    action.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p class="px-4">
                    <strong>Why:</strong> We need callback function because many
                    Javascript actions are asynchronous which means they don't
                    really stop the program (or a function) from running until
                    they're completed. <br />
                    If I want to do asynchronous work synchronously then I need
                    to use callback function. <br />
                    Or when we want to do database related asynchronous work
                    then we need to use callback function.
